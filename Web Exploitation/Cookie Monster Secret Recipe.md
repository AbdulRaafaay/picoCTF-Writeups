## 🔍 Challenge Overview

The challenge gives us a Cookie Monster–themed website. Since the description explicitly mentions cookies, the focus should be on browser storage.  
By attempting a login and following the hint about cookies, we uncover the hidden flag.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Cookies Reveal the Flag

### ✅ Step 1: Attempt Login

On visiting the site, we tried common credentials:

```

Username: admin
Password: admin

```

The site responded with:

```

Access Denied

```

and displayed an **additional message about cookies**. This was a strong hint to check the browser’s cookies.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Inspect Cookies

Opening Chrome DevTools and navigating to:

```

Application > Storage > Cookies

```

we found a suspicious cookie value. It wasn’t human-readable and looked encoded.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Decode the Cookie

We copied the cookie value into **CyberChef**.  
After applying a **From Base64**, the flag appeared in plain text.

## 🏁 Flag
