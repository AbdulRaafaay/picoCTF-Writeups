## 🔍 Challenge Overview

We’re given a website that doesn’t show much at first.  
The description hints at **cookies**, so the solution involves checking and manipulating stored cookies in the browser until we uncover the correct one holding the flag.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Manipulating Cookies

### ✅ Step 1: Inspect Cookies

We opened **DevTools → Application → Cookies** and found a cookie with:

```

Key   = name
Value = -1

```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Modify the Cookie Value

Since the challenge asked us to find the “best” cookie, we incremented the value of `name` step by step, starting from `0`.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Iterate Through Values

For each value, we refreshed the page:

- Negative values were invalid.  
- Positive numbers started showing valid responses.  
- At **18**, the page finally revealed the hidden flag.

## 🏁 Flag

## 💡 Takeaways

* Always check for **cookies** when solving web exploitation challenges.  
* Cookies can often be manipulated to test hidden conditions.  
* Incrementing or fuzzing cookie values may lead to discovering secret functionality.  
* In real-world applications, cookies should be properly validated server-side to prevent tampering.
