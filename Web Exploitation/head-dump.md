## 🧠 Description

> Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag.
>
> The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the server’s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.
>
> Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## 🔍 Challenge Overview

We’re given a blog-style web application with different articles and hashtags. One of the hashtags leads to the API documentation page, which contains an interesting endpoint `/heapdump` that reveals server memory.
By downloading the memory dump, we can search for the flag directly.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Finding the Flag in Heap Dump

### ✅ Step 1: Navigate to API Documentation

While browsing the site, we found an interesting hashtag:

```
#API Documentation
```

Clicking on it took us to:

```
http://<ip>/api-docs/
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Locate the `/heapdump` Endpoint

Scrolling through the Swagger API docs, we found a **GET** request to:

```
/heapdump
```

This endpoint is listed under the “Diagnosing” section.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Execute the Endpoint

Inside Swagger UI:

1. Click **Try it out**.
2. Click **Execute**.

This triggered the endpoint and returned a downloadable file containing the server’s heap memory.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Search the Dump for the Flag

After downloading the file, we opened it in a text editor and searched for:

```
picoCTF
```

The search revealed the hidden flag inside the memory dump.

## 🏁 Flag

```
picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
```

## 💡 Takeaways

* Swagger or API documentation endpoints can leak sensitive debugging or diagnostic tools.
* Heap dumps may contain credentials, secrets, and flags because they capture raw memory.
* Always disable or secure diagnostic endpoints in production environments.
