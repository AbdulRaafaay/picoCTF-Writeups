## 🔍 Challenge Overview

The description hints at **minified code**. Inspecting the source reveals the site’s code is compressed into a single line. By unminifying it and searching through the code, we can uncover the hidden flag.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Unminifying the Code

### ✅ Step 1: View Source

After launching the challenge site, we opened the page source with:

```

Right-click > View Page Source

```

The code was indeed **minified** into one long line.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Unminify the Code

We copied the minified source code and pasted it into an online tool:

```

[https://unminify.com/](https://unminify.com/)

```

This formatted the code into a more readable structure.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Search for the Flag

Once formatted, we used:

```

Ctrl + F  →  picoCTF{

```

The search revealed the hidden flag directly in the source.

## 🏁 Flag

```

picoCTF{<REDACTED>}

```

## 💡 Takeaways

* Challenge descriptions often hint at the intended method — here, “squished” = minified.  
* Minified JavaScript/HTML often hides important strings that can be revealed by reformatting.
* Online tools like **unminify.com** or browser extensions can quickly reformat compressed code.
