## 🔍 Challenge Overview

We’re given a simple webpage with a **"Say Hello"** button.  
Clicking it triggered an alert saying: *"This code is in a separate file!"*.  
Inspecting the site’s source code revealed two included files — one CSS and one JavaScript. Each file contained part of the flag.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Retrieving the Flag from Included Files

### ✅ Step 1: Interact with the Button

Clicking on the **"Say Hello"** button displayed an alert message:

```

This code is in a separate file!

```

This hinted that the flag (or clues to it) might be hidden in external resources.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Inspect Source Code

Opening the page source showed references to:

```

style.css
script.js

```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Check the CSS File

Visiting `style.css`, we found **the first half of the flag** commented inside.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Check the JavaScript File

Opening `script.js`, we found **the second half of the flag** hidden in a comment.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Combine Both Halves

By joining both halves from the CSS and JS files, we reconstructed the full flag.

## 🏁 Flag

## 💡 Takeaways

* Always inspect external resources (CSS, JS, images) — flags are often hidden there in beginner web challenges.  
* HTML comments and file includes are common hiding places in CTF problems.  
* Real-world lesson: don’t leave sensitive information in publicly accessible static files.
