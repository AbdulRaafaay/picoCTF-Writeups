## 🔍 Challenge Overview  

We’re given a website that doesn’t directly display a flag. The challenge title emphasizes **HEAD**, which hints at using an HTTP `HEAD` request instead of a standard `GET`. By sending a `HEAD` request to the server, we can retrieve the hidden flag inside the response headers.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Using HTTP HEAD Requests  

### ✅ Step 1: Normal Visit  

Visiting the site with a browser only shows a simple page, but no visible flag.  

---  

### ✅ Step 2: Interpret the Hint  

The challenge name `GET aHEAD` suggests checking HTTP request methods. Unlike `GET`, the `HEAD` method only fetches **headers** without the page content.  

---  

### ✅ Step 3: Send a HEAD Request  

Using `curl` with the `-I` option, we can send a `HEAD` request:  

```bash
curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967/
````

The server responds with headers, and among them, we see the **flag embedded directly in the response**.

## 💡 Takeaways

* Always pay attention to **challenge titles** — they often hint at the technique required.
* HTTP request methods (`GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, etc.) can reveal different server behaviors.
* The `HEAD` method is useful for retrieving metadata without downloading full content.
* Tools like `curl` make it easy to experiment with different HTTP methods quickly.
