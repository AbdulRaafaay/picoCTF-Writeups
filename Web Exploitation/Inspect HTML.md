## 🔍 Challenge Overview

We’re given a very simple webpage. The challenge name and description hint at using the **HTML inspector or viewing the source code**.  
By inspecting the page source, we discover the flag hidden inside an HTML comment.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Inspecting the Page Source

### ✅ Step 1: Open the Webpage

After launching the instance, we visited the provided site.  
The page appeared very minimal with no obvious content revealing a flag.

---

### ✅ Step 2: View Page Source

We opened the page source with:

```

Ctrl + U   (or right-click → View Page Source)

````

---

### ✅ Step 3: Find Hidden Comment

Scrolling through the HTML, we found a hidden comment:

```html
<!-- picoCTF{<REDACTED>} -->
````

This comment contained the full flag.

## 🏁 Flag

```
picoCTF{<REDACTED>}
```

## 💡 Takeaways

* Always inspect the **HTML source code** — flags are often hidden in comments or unused elements.
* CTF challenges frequently test basic DevTools skills like “View Page Source.”
* In real-world scenarios, sensitive data should never be left in publicly accessible comments or code.
