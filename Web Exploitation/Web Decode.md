## 🔍 Challenge Overview

The challenge description directly hints at using the **browser’s inspector**. By exploring the source code of the site’s pages with DevTools, we can find hidden encoded data that reveals the flag when decoded.

---

## 🧪 Exploitation – Inspecting the Pages

### ✅ Step 1: Explore the Website

The website contained **three pages**: Home, About, and another section.  
Since the description mentioned the inspector, we checked each page using:

```

Right-click > Inspect

```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Suspicious Value in About Page

On the **About** page, we noticed a suspicious variable named:

```

notify\_true

```

Its value was a **Base64 encoded string**.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Decode the String

We copied the encoded string into **CyberChef**.  
Using the **From Base64** operation, the hidden flag was revealed in plain text.

## 🏁 Flag

```

picoCTF{<REDACTED>}

```
