## 🔍 Challenge Overview

We’re given a simple website with no obvious flag on the landing page. The challenge description hints at hidden information around the site. By progressively inspecting different files and common hidden paths, we can piece together all parts of the flag.  

---

## 🧪 Exploitation – Hunting for Hidden Files

### ✅ Step 1: Inspect the Source Code  

Opening the **page source**, we immediately found the **first part of the flag** inside an HTML comment.  

---

### ✅ Step 2: Check Linked CSS  

The site referenced a CSS file. Looking into it, we discovered the **second part of the flag**.  

---

### ✅ Step 3: Analyze JavaScript for Hints  

A linked JavaScript file contained a **hint to check `/robots.txt`**. Visiting that file revealed the **third part of the flag**, along with a clue about an **Apache server**.  

---

### ✅ Step 4: Test Apache-Specific Files  

Using common Apache-related hidden files, we explored:  

```

/server-status
/.htpasswd
/.htaccess

```

The **fourth part of the flag** was hidden inside `/.htaccess`, which also mentioned a **Mac Store**.  

---

### ✅ Step 5: Mac Store Clue → `.DS_Store`  

Recognizing the Mac reference, we checked `/.DS_Store` and found the **fifth and final part of the flag**.

## 💡 Takeaways  

* Always start with **View Source** — flags or hints often hide in comments.  
* Don’t forget to check linked **CSS** and **JS** files.  
* Explore **robots.txt** for disallowed paths — they frequently hide secrets in CTFs.  
* Recognize hints pointing to common misconfigurations (e.g., `/.htaccess`, `/.DS_Store`).  
* CTF web challenges often simulate real-world mistakes like leaving sensitive files exposed.
