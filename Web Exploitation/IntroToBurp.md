## 🔍 Challenge Overview

We’re presented with a **registration page**. After registering, the site asks for an OTP (One-Time Password). Since the challenge title references **Burp**, it’s clear the solution involves inspecting HTTP traffic with Burp Suite.  
By analyzing the requests, we discover that the OTP is encoded inside the session token.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Capturing the OTP

### ✅ Step 1: Registration Attempt

Visiting the challenge site, we registered with arbitrary details.  
The site responded by asking for an **OTP** before proceeding.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Intercept Traffic with Burp

We launched **Burp Suite** and intercepted the HTTP requests.  
When submitting the registration form and landing on the OTP page, a **POST request** was made, including a **session token**.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Inspect the Session Token

Inside Burp, the session token looked like an encoded string.  
On closer inspection, it appeared to be **Base64 URL-encoded**.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Decode the Token

We copied the session token and used **CyberChef** (or Burp’s decoder) to perform **Base64 URL decode**.  
The decoded content revealed the **OTP** directly.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Enter the OTP

Entering the decoded OTP into the website completed the login and revealed the flag.

## 🏁 Flag

## 💡 Takeaways

* Burp Suite is an essential tool for intercepting and analyzing HTTP requests.  
* Session tokens sometimes carry sensitive data (e.g., OTPs, flags) if they’re improperly encoded instead of securely encrypted.  
* Base64 (and Base64 URL-safe) encoding is commonly used — always try decoding suspicious tokens.  
* Never trust tokens to be opaque in real-world apps; attackers can often extract hidden data.
