## 🧠 Description

> Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?  
> Browse here, and find the flag!  

---

## 🔍 Challenge Overview

The challenge provides a webpage containing **JavaScript code** in the form of a bookmarklet function. Instead of hiding the flag in the page source, the flag is revealed by **executing the function in the browser**.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Running the Bookmarklet

### ✅ Step 1: Visit the Website

On visiting the site, the page displayed a snippet of **JavaScript code**.  
It resembled a bookmarklet function designed to be run directly in the browser.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Open Browser Console

We opened the **Developer Tools console** in Chrome:

```

Ctrl + Shift + I → Console

```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Execute the Code

We copied the JavaScript function from the page and pasted it into the console.  
After running the code, the browser displayed an **alert box** containing the hidden flag.

## 💡 Takeaways

* Bookmarklets are small JavaScript snippets that can be run directly in the browser to perform actions.  
* In CTFs, bookmarklets often directly reveal hidden flags when executed.  
* Always try running provided JavaScript code in the browser console (but only in safe CTF environments).  
* Understanding how to use DevTools (console, inspector) is crucial for web exploitation challenges.
