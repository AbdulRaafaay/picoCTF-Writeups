## 🧠 Description

> Can you get the flag?

## 🔍 Challenge Overview

We’re given a simple **login page**. The challenge hints at using browser inspector/DevTools. By analyzing the site’s network requests, we discover a hidden JavaScript file that contains the valid credentials. Logging in with those credentials reveals the flag.

## 🧪 Exploitation – Finding Hidden Credentials

### ✅ Step 1: Attempt Login

After launching the challenge, we were presented with a login form.  
We tried:

```

Username: admin
Password: 123

```

This attempt failed, but while inspecting the **Network tab** in DevTools, we noticed additional requests being made.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Inspect Network Traffic

In the **Network** tab, we saw a request to:

```

secure.js

```

This looked suspicious, so we opened it directly in the browser.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Analyze secure.js

The `secure.js` file contained hardcoded credentials for the login system.  
Copying those credentials gave us the exact username and password required.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Login with Correct Credentials

Using the credentials from `secure.js`, we successfully logged in to the site, and the flag was displayed on the page.

## 🏁 Flag

```

picoCTF{<REDACTED>}

```

## 💡 Takeaways

* Always check the **Network tab** in DevTools for extra resources being loaded (JS, API calls, etc.).  
* Sensitive credentials should never be stored client-side in production environments.  
* Inspecting JavaScript files often reveals hidden logic or clues in web CTF challenges.  
* Even failed login attempts can provide hints when analyzed alongside network traffic.
